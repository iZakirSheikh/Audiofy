            \n - Added a new experimental "Acrylic Blur" effect for a modern, semi-transparent UI. You can enable it in Settings.
            \n - Tapping the mini-player (Floating Action Button) now expands it, while a long press takes you to the console. This behavior can be toggled in settings.
            \n - Significantly improved app startup speed and overall performance by centralizing how settings are loaded.
            \n - Improved handling of screen padding and system cutouts (notches/insets) for a more consistent look.
            \n - Adopted the latest Kotlin features and updated internal libraries for better stability.
